# Find the factors -- a program to check my daughter's 4th grade math homework

- creates a dictionary with factor values to reference, in order to save computing time when getting to larger numbers
- ultimately, would like to use a factor set as a basis for an art project

ToDo
- matplotlib visualization with the factor sets in the dictionary
