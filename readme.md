# Find the factors -- a program to check my daughter's 4th grade math homework

Run the program 
- Download the python file: factor_finder.py
- Run from terminal.
- cd to the directory the file is in abd type:

`python3 factor_finder.py`

- put in a number, get the factors!

How it works
- creates a dictionary with factor values to reference, in order to save computing time when getting to larger numbers

ToDo
- ultimately, would like to use a factor set as a basis for an art project. adding factors. multiplying factors. prime weirdness...
- matplotlib visualization with the factor sets
